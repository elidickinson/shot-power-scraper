*Original project badges: [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/shot-scraper/) | [Changelog](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/releases) | [Tests](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/actions?query=workflow%3ATest) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/EE7Hx4Kbny)*

A command-line utility for taking automated screenshots of websites, now powered by **nodriver** for enhanced stealth and anti-detection capabilities.

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a fork of the original [shot-scraper](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper)** that has been migrated from Playwright to [nodriver](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/nodriver), providing built-in bypass capabilities for CAPTCHAs and Cloudflare bot detection.

## Documentation

- [Full documentation for shot-power-scraper](https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/)
- [Tutorial: Automating screenshots for the Datasette documentation using shot-power-scraper](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/14/automating-screenshots/)
- [Release notes](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/releases)

## Get started with GitHub Actions

To get started without installing any software, use the [shot-scraper-template](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-template) template to create your own GitHub repository which takes screenshots of a page using `shot-power-scraper`. See [Instantly create a GitHub repository to take screenshots of a web page](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/14/shot-scraper-template/) for details.

## Installation

Since this is a fork and not published to PyPI, you need to install it from this repository:

### Option 1: Clone and run directly
```bash
git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
cd shot-power-scraper
pip install click pyyaml nodriver click-default-group
python3 main.py --help
```

### Option 2: Install with uv (recommended)
```bash
git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
cd shot-power-scraper
uv run python3 main.py --help
```

### Option 3: Install as editable package
```bash
git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
cd shot-power-scraper
pip install -e .
shot-power-scraper --help
```

**Requirements**: Chrome or Chromium must be installed on your system. No driver installation required!

## Taking your first screenshot

You can take a screenshot of a web page like this:

    shot-power-scraper https://datasette.io/

This will create a screenshot in a file called `datasette-io.png`.

> **Note**: If you haven't installed the package, use `python3 main.py` instead of `shot-power-scraper` in all commands.

## Anti-Detection Features

This version includes comprehensive stealth capabilities that make it much harder to detect than standard automation tools:

### Enhanced Stealth with nodriver

Unlike Playwright and other automation frameworks, **nodriver** provides built-in anti-detection that bypasses most bot detection systems.

**Why nodriver is stealthier:**
- **No automation markers**: Removes `webdriver` properties and other automation signatures
- **Natural behavior simulation**: Mimics human-like browsing patterns
- **Advanced fingerprint masking**: Hides automation-specific JavaScript properties
- **Evasion techniques**: Built-in methods to avoid detection by anti-bot services

### Required: Set Up Stealth User Agent

**For maximum stealth effectiveness, you must run this command once after installation:**

    shot-power-scraper set-default-user-agent

What this does:
1. Launches Chrome in headless mode to detect your system's actual user agent
2. Finds something like: `Mozilla/5.0 ... HeadlessChrome/129.0.0.0 ...`
3. Changes "HeadlessChrome" to just "Chrome"
4. Saves this as your default user agent in `~/.config/shot-power-scraper/config.json`

Now all your screenshots will use this normal-looking user agent automatically:

    shot-power-scraper https://example.com  # Uses stealth + custom user agent
    shot-power-scraper --user-agent "Custom" https://example.com  # Override when needed

**The combination of nodriver's built-in stealth + proper user agent makes this tool significantly more effective than standard automation frameworks at bypassing bot detection.**

### Cloudflare Bypass
Automatic detection and bypassing of Cloudflare challenges:

    shot-power-scraper https://cloudflare-protected-site.com

The tool automatically:
- Detects Cloudflare "Just a moment..." pages
- Waits for challenges to complete
- Continues with screenshot capture

### Ad Blocking
Built-in ad blocking using Chrome extension technology:

    shot-power-scraper --ad-block https://example.com

Features:
- Blocks ads, trackers, and other unwanted content
- Uses filter lists to identify and block advertising elements
- Works with both single screenshots and multi-shot configurations
- Improves page load times and reduces visual clutter

### Annoyance Manager
Automatic removal of common webpage annoyances:

    shot-power-scraper https://example.com  # Annoyance removal runs automatically

The tool automatically:
- Dismisses cookie consent banners
- Closes newsletter signup popups
- Removes overlay dialogs and modals
- Clicks "No thanks" buttons on subscription prompts
- Handles common UI elements that block content

This ensures cleaner screenshots by removing elements that typically appear on first visit but wouldn't be present for regular users.

Many more options are available, see [Taking a screenshot](https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/screenshots.html) for details.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Differences from Original shot-power-scraper

This fork has significant differences from the original shot-scraper. **Several commands do not work or have limited functionality.**

### üö´ **Commands That Don't Work**
- `shot-power-scraper pdf` - PDF generation not implemented with nodriver
- `shot-power-scraper accessibility` - Accessibility tree dumping not available in nodriver
- `shot-power-scraper har` - HAR file recording not implemented with nodriver

### üîÑ **Commands With Limited Functionality**
- Console logging (`--log-console`) - Limited support compared to Playwright
- Request/response monitoring - Limited compared to Playwright
- Browser selection (`--browser`) - Only Chrome/Chromium supported (no Firefox/WebKit)

### ‚úÖ **Commands That Work Fully**
- `shot-power-scraper` (screenshots) - Full functionality
- `shot-power-scraper javascript` - Full functionality
- `shot-power-scraper html` - Full functionality
- `shot-power-scraper multi` - Full functionality
- `shot-power-scraper auth` - Works with some limitations
- `shot-power-scraper install` - Now just shows info message (no installation needed)

### üÜï **New Commands**
- `shot-power-scraper set-default-user-agent` - Configure stealth user agent

### üéØ **Why This Fork? Benefits of nodriver Migration**
- **No driver management** - Uses your installed Chrome/Chromium directly
- **Anti-detection capabilities** - Bypasses CAPTCHAs and Cloudflare automatically
- **Better performance** - Async architecture throughout
- **Stealth mode** - Undetected automation that doesn't reveal "HeadlessChrome"
- **Simplified setup** - No separate browser or driver downloads needed

**Trade-off**: Some original shot-scraper functionality is lost, but you gain powerful anti-detection capabilities for web scraping scenarios.

### ü§î **Should You Use This Fork?**
- **Use this fork if**: You need to bypass Cloudflare, avoid CAPTCHA challenges, or require stealth browsing for web scraping
- **Use the original if**: You need PDF generation, HAR recording, accessibility features, or multi-browser support


## Configuration & Defaults

shot-power-scraper stores default settings in `~/.shot-power-scraper/config.json` that apply to all commands unless overridden with command-line options.

### How It Works
- Settings in the config file become the new defaults for all commands
- Command-line options always override config file settings
- Currently supports setting a default user agent (more defaults may be added in the future)

### Example Config File
After running `shot-power-scraper set-default-user-agent`, your config file will look like:
```json
{
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/129.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
}
```

This user agent (with "Chrome" instead of "HeadlessChrome") will be used for all screenshots automatically.

**Note**: Config file uses `user_agent` (underscore) while command line uses `--user-agent` (hyphen). This is the standard convention for Python CLI tools.

üìñ **See [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) for a complete reference of all configuration options.**

## Code Structure

The codebase has been refactored for better maintainability and clarity:

- **`shot_power_scraper/cli.py`** - Main CLI interface with all command definitions and decorators
- **`shot_power_scraper/browser.py`** - Browser management and initialization
- **`shot_power_scraper/screenshot.py`** - Core screenshot functionality and element selection
- **`shot_power_scraper/page_utils.py`** - Page interaction utilities (JavaScript evaluation, Cloudflare bypass, DOM ready detection)
- **`shot_power_scraper/utils.py`** - General utility functions

## Examples

- The [shot-scraper-demo](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-demo) repository uses this tool to capture recently spotted owls in El Granada, CA according to [this page](https://www.owlsnearme.com/?place=127871), and to  generate an annotated screenshot illustrating a Datasette feature as described [in my blog](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/10/shot-scraper/#a-complex-example).
- The [Datasette Documentation](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/) uses screenshots taken by `shot-power-scraper` running in the [simonw/datasette-screenshots](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-screenshots) GitHub repository, described in detail in [Automating screenshots for the Datasette documentation using shot-power-scraper](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/14/automating-screenshots/).
- Ben Welsh built [@newshomepages](https://twitter.com/newshomepages), a Twitter bot that uses `shot-power-scraper` and GitHub Actions to take screenshots of news website homepages and publish them to Twitter. The code for that lives in [palewire/news-homepages](https://github.com/palewire/news-homepages).
- [scrape-hacker-news-by-domain](https://github.com/simonw/scrape-hacker-news-by-domain) uses `shot-power-scraper javascript` to scrape a web page. See [Scraping web pages from the command-line with shot-power-scraper](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/14/scraping-web-pages-shot-scraper/) for details of how this works.
- Reuters uses shot-power-scraper to generate regularly updating data dashboards [for email newsletters](https://twitter.com/palewire/status/1658069533763026944).
