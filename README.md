# shot-power-scraper

> A command-line utility for taking automated screenshots of websites, powered by **nodriver** for enhanced stealth and anti-detection capabilities.

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/blob/master/LICENSE)

This is a fork of Simon Willison's excellent [shot-scraper](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper), migrated from Playwright to [nodriver](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/nodriver). This provides powerful, built-in bypass capabilities for CAPTCHAs and services like Cloudflare.

## Installation

The easiest way to install this tool is with `uv`:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/elidickinson/shot-power-scraper.git
```

Then run the `install` command to verify that it can find your browser:
```bash
shot-power-scraper install
```

**Requirements**: Google Chrome or Chromium must be installed on your system. No separate driver installation is required.

## Taking your first screenshot

You can take a screenshot of a web page like this:

    shot-power-scraper https://datasette.io/

This will create a screenshot in a file called `datasette-io.png`.

## Anti-Detection Features

This fork includes comprehensive stealth capabilities that make it much harder to detect than standard automation tools.

### Enhanced Stealth with nodriver

Unlike Playwright and other automation frameworks, **nodriver** provides built-in anti-detection that bypasses most bot detection systems by removing automation markers, simulating natural browser behavior, and masking its fingerprint.

### Required: Set Up Stealth User Agent

For stealth features to work when running in headless mode (the default) you must run the install command once to set up the correct user agent:

    shot-power-scraper install


### Ad and Popup Blocking

This fork has a simple custom ad blocking extension. If called with --ad-block it blocks most ads and with --popup-block it blocks most modal dialogs, popups and cookie consent banners.

    shot-power-scraper --ad-block https://example.com

This can be enabled by default using the `config` command.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Differences from Original shot-scraper

This fork has some important differences from the original. It only supports Chrome/Chromium and some features aren't fully implemented.

### üö´ **Commands & Features That Don't Work**
- `shot-power-scraper har` - Not implemented.
- `shot-power-scraper accessibility` - Not implemented.
- `--log-requests` option is not implemented.
- Selectors like `-s` don't currently work correctly with screenshots
- `--quality` to specify JPEG quality not implemented.

### üîÑ **Commands With Limited Functionality**
- Console logging (`--log-console`) - Basic CDP implementation, may miss some message types.
- Browser selection (`--browser`) - Only Chrome/Chromium is supported.

## üìã **Command Status**

- ‚úÖ `shot`: Fully Implemented (except `--log-requests`)
- ‚úÖ `multi`: Fully Implemented (except HAR options)
- ‚úÖ `pdf`: Fully Implemented
- ‚úÖ `javascript`: Fully Implemented
- ‚úÖ `html`: Fully Implemented
- ‚úÖ `auth`: Fully Implemented
- ‚úÖ `install`: Fully Implemented - also sets up user agent for stealth mode
- ‚úÖ `config`: Fully Implemented

## Configuration & Defaults

`shot-power-scraper` stores default settings in `~/.config/shot-power-scraper/config.json`. These settings are used unless overridden by command-line options.

### Configuration Commands
```bash
# Set default ad and popup blocking
shot-power-scraper config --ad-block true --popup-block true

# View current settings
shot-power-scraper config --show

# Clear all settings
shot-power-scraper config --clear
```

## Examples

The following examples use the original `shot-scraper`, but the concepts can be adapted for this fork.

- The [shot-scraper-demo](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-demo) repository uses the tool to capture recently spotted owls in El Granada, CA.
- The [Datasette Documentation](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/) uses screenshots taken by `shot-scraper`.
- Ben Welsh built [@newshomepages](https://twitter.com/newshomepages), a Twitter bot that uses `shot-scraper` and GitHub Actions to take and publish screenshots of news homepages.
- [scrape-hacker-news-by-domain](https://github.com/simonw/scrape-hacker-news-by-domain) uses `shot-scraper javascript` to scrape a web page.
