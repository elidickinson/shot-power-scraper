# ABP Rule Support Analysis Report

Analysis of cosmetic filter support after implementation improvements.

## Current Support Status

After fixes (increased character limit to 1000, allowed CSS combinators, fixed attribute selector validation):

**Coverage:** ~98% of cosmetic rules in analyzed filter lists are supported

## Remaining Unsupported Rules (~2%)

### 1. Element Removal Rules (~453 rules)
**Examples:**
```
##selector:remove()
##selector { remove: true; }
```
**What it does:** Removes elements from DOM instead of hiding them
**Implementation Difficulty:** **Hard** - Requires DOM manipulation beyond CSS hiding

### 2. uBlock Origin Procedural Cosmetics (~315 rules)
**Examples:**
```
##span:has-text(/Newsletter/i)
##div:style(position: absolute !important)
##div:matches-css(display: block)
```
**What it does:** Advanced DOM querying and CSS property matching
**Implementation Difficulty:** **Hard** - Requires JavaScript execution and DOM traversal

## Analysis Summary

**Filter Files Analyzed:**
- `adguard-popups-full.txt` - 96.4% supported (440 unsupported)
- `easylist-newsletters-ubo.txt` - 94.5% supported (315 unsupported)
- `i-dont-care-about-cookies.txt` - 100% supported (0 unsupported)
- `anti-adblock-killer.txt` - 100% supported (0 unsupported)

## Issues Fixed

1. **Character limit increased** from 200 to 1000 characters
2. **CSS child combinator** (`>`) now supported
3. **CSS attribute selectors** (`[attr^="value"]`) now supported
4. **Complex domain exclusion lists** now supported

## Summary

The current implementation supports standard CSS selectors well. Remaining unsupported rules are primarily uBlock Origin extensions that require DOM manipulation beyond standard CSS capabilities.
